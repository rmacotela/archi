# Archimate to BPMN Mapping
This is a model containing a mapping between archimate and BPMN. To achieve this mapping, archimate specializations are used together with the elementÂ´s properties.  
  
Also in the model, we can find a BPMN example of the very well known Pizza Delivery business process.  
  
This model can be opened with the Archi tool.
